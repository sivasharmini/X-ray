NIH Chest X-ray Dataset
National Institutes of Health Chest X-Ray Dataset
Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations available. However, clinical diagnosis of a chest X-ray can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. The lack of large publicly available datasets with annotations means it is still very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites with chest X-rays. One major hurdle in creating large X-ray image datasets is the lack resources for labeling so many images. Prior to the release of this dataset, Openi was the largest publicly available source of chest X-ray images with 4,143 images available.
